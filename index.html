    My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from school I like to read such books after completing my homework. I am 11 years old and read in class 6th standard. Now I know very well that readingis very good habit which can make me a complete. This hooby can developeed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reding books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and istruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly and successful person in the life.
